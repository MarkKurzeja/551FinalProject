# 551FinalProject

## To Do
- The presentation needs work in the following places
  - Need to update the model specification
  - Need to add in the heat map / visualizations
  - Confirm with yang that we only need prelim analysis (look on Canvas)
- Begin the analysis
  - We need to look into RStanarm and basic linear models
  - Data visualization additions?
- Finish the project
  - Begin the implementation of the model in STAN
  - Look at the LMM model that was championed in the tutorials (it is located in the slides - I put a link near the end)
- Conquer the world

## Done
- Find a data set

## Project Ideas
School Fires in Sweden
Data from 1998-2014. Pretty rich numerically, and offers different options for mixed effect modeling (e.g. comparing behavior of rural/urban counties, or counties of different political stripes). The main numerical predictors here are economic.
