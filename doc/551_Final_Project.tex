% =====================================
% Purpose: Create a Robert Bringhurst style thesis paper using the 
% classicthesis package and some custom enhancements - this is 
% the default template for most of my documents
% =====================================

% =====================================
% Document Class and main packages
% =====================================

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper, hidelinks]{article} % KOMA-Script article scrartcl
\usepackage[nochapters, pdfspacing]{classicthesis} % [nochapters] [drafting] (puts date/time at bottom) [beramono] (changed mono spaced font)

% =====================================
% Packages in Use
% =====================================

%Math Packages
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{nicefrac} % For typsetting inline fractions
\usepackage{mathtools} % For substack and mathclap (underbrace helper commands)

%% Typography enhancements
\usepackage{microtype} % For awesome typographical improvements
\usepackage{booktabs} % Pretty \begin{tabular}
\usepackage{multicol} % For pretty multi-columns enviroments
\usepackage{xspace} % For use in a command to ensure proper spacing
%\usepackage{geometry} %uncomment this is you want full page documentation
\usepackage{graphicx} % for allowing pictures
\usepackage{float} % For the purpose of adding \begin{figure} [H]
\usepackage{lipsum} % For adding filler text
\usepackage{wasysym} % For the \newmoon command for the legal blobs

% For commenting on incomplete or new items
\usepackage{todonotes} % \missingfigure{} is the best command

% For inclusion of PDFs in the document \includepdf[pages={3,{},8-11,15}]{example.pdf}
% This will include page 3, a blank page, 8,9,10,11, and 15
% you can set this to draft to get boxes or final to get the default which includes
% the pages
% Options:
% 	fitpaper: Use this to insert the page as is - otherwise items are scaled to page
% 	rotateoversize: Attempt to rotate oversized pages and scale them
\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}

% =====================================
% Graphics 
% =====================================

% For quick graphics insert -- Full Line --
\newcommand{\qpic}[2]{
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./#1}
\caption{#2}
\label{fig:#1}
\end{figure}
}

% For quick graphics insert -- Normal Size --
\newcommand{\qpics}[2]{
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./#1}
\caption{#2}
\label{fig:#1}
\end{figure}
}

% Auto-commas for long nominal and dollar amounts
\RequirePackage{siunitx}
\newcommand{\commasep}[1]{\num[group-separator={,}]{#1}}
\newcommand{\money}[1]{\$\commasep{#1}}

% Borrowing from tufte, this is the \newthought command that is

% to another and is a good way to bring things up logically into smaller
% bites

% For handling code blocks and other text
% =====================================

% Code to handle inputting code segments in R

  tabsize=2,	                   % sets default tabsize to 2 spaces
  title=\lstname                   % show the filename of files included with \lstinputlisting; also try caption instead of title
